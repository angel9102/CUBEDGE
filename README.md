# CUBEDGE
Videogame developed using Unity Engine

This 3D videogame consists of dodging obstacles along the way.
All prefabs are already created in the project, so in order to scale the game and making more levels you only need to design the level itself using the prefabs.
After downloading the project you can simply run the game by going to the Aplicacion folder and launching the .exe file. 
Check "CUBEDGE - Memoria" for the game making of.
Have fun!
